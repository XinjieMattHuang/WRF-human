# WRF-human

This repository contains human thermal stress data presented in the WRF-human manuscript, as well as codes used to plot figures in the manuscript. 

Codes are directly included in the GitHub folder, and the original datasets are too large (~1000MB per dataset) thus can be assessed via this OneDrive link: https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/xjmhuang_connect_hku_hk/Ej_XUbsqeVFNsAQB5TJDQ1IB5igiX9z8O3TAqQAimioqcw
